Gravity Simulator

This Python script simulates the behavior of objects falling under gravity onto a surface with no energy loss. Objects bounce back with the same speed they hit the surface. It's a simple yet illustrative tool for understanding gravitational physics.
Features:

    Accurate simulation of gravitational forces.
    Objects bounce off the surface with equal velocity.
    Easy-to-understand code structure for educational purposes.

Usage:

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Clone the repository.
    Run the gravity_simulator.py script.
    Input parameters such as object mass, initial velocity, and gravitational acceleration.
    Watch as the simulation demonstrates the physics of gravity and collision.
